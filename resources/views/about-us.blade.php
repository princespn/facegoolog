                    <p>At PermitSearch.com we believe there shouldn’t be any surprises when buying or selling a home. But too often, buyers start the purchase process only to find unpermitted work or open permits that derail the home buying process.</p>
                    <p> Discovering unpermitted work can cause a slowdown in the purchase process, unhappy home buyers, and frustrated real estate agents. But all that’s about to change...
                    </p>
                    <p>Permit Search was born out of the realization that acquiring the permit status for a home is more difficult than it should be. Some towns are fully digitized, making the permit search a simple process. Others are still using pen and
                        paper, requiring formal requests and in-person pickup. Not only is this ‘last decade’ it’s also an unsustainable process for the future.</p>
                    <p>The digital world gets their information online and so should you. Enter PermitSearch.com. Our mission is to make permit data easily accessible to anyone thinking of buying or selling a home and everyone who relies on permit information
                        for real estate transactions.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our solution is bridging the digital divide. We offer transparency into permit and inspection data through a simple address search. If permit history is available from the target locale, it can be downloaded in the form of a PDF report.
                        If not available, we help you initiate an information request and deliver permit history once it’s provided by the city of record. This simplifies your permit history search and supports the evolution of access to permit data.</p>
                    <p>We are working with cities all over the United States who are in the process of digitizing their permit information. As the data becomes available, we add it to our system. This provides an ongoing and improved data set, helping more
                        consumers buy the house of their dreams – with few surprises. As our data grows, so will access to this valuable information that can transform the buying and selling process for millions of home owners and the professionals who
                        represent them.
