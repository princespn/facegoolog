                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>We offer a wide range of services that focus on all stages of the home lifecycle: renting, buying, selling, financing, and home improvement.
                    </p>
                    <p>We know that everyone’s home journey is different, and that deciding on the right place to call home is an intimate, personal experience.  Along with a wealth of information about homes, neighborhoods, market conditions, local real
                        estate professionals, and financing options, we also use the information you give us to provide our services and help you find your next home.</p>
                    <p>We carefully evaluate how we use data to make sure that we’re using your information to provide value for you.  On this page, we aim to explain everything you need to know about your privacy at Permit Search.   </p>

                    <h3>Information collected by Permit Search</h3>
                    <p>When you use our services, we collect a variety of information from and about you and your devices.  Some of this information identifies you directly (like an email address) while some of it is associated with you through your account,
                        profile, or device (like the homes you choose to save or your location data).</p>
                    <p>The kind of data we collect about you depends on how you use Permit Search.  If you only use our services to browse for permits, we’ll have less information about you than if you use any of our other transaction services.  Even if
                        you don’t have an account with us, we may still collect some data about you, like your email address and phone number if you choose to contact a real estate agent through our platform, or your IP address and other device information
                        when you browse our sites or use our apps.</p>

                    <h3>Information you give us or create using our services</h3>
                    <p>When you use our services, we often ask you for information about yourself.  This usually includes basic things like your name, email address, and phone number.

                    </p>
                    <p>Below are some examples of what information we collect for our main products and services and how we collect it.</p>
                    <h4>Home Search</h4>
                    <p>When you use Permit Search to find permit data, we give you information about a particular residence.  If you tell us what you’re looking for, including the address, we save that information so that we can tailor your search results.</p>
                    <h4>Services </h4>
                    <p>If you are a user of our site, you may be able to connect your third-party email account (such as Gmail) to your Permit Search account.  If you enable that connection, Permit Search will access your messages, contacts, and settings
                        only to provide the requested services to you.  We do not access or collect any of the contents of your email messages in providing interest-based advertising.  We use information received from Gmail APIs only in compliance with
                        <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy"> Google’s Limited Use Requirements.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>We also collect your contact and payment details, along with professional information such as brokerage affiliation, associated listings and sales, and licensing history.</p>
                    <h4>Information from Public Sources and Third Parties</h4>
                    <p>Permit Search collects information from public sources, such as county and state tax and property records, government agencies, and multiple listing services (or MLS).  Most of this information is about properties, not people.  But
                        some information we collect, like the identity of a property’s owner or real estate license information, may relate to individuals.</p>
                    <p>We also collect information about you from various third parties in order to provide better service to you, or as part of the employment application process.  This may include demographic information and other attributes about you.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="Policy-grid">
                    <h3>Information we collect as you use our services</h3>
                    <p>Along with the information you give us directly, we collect a variety of information automatically as you use Permit Search services.</p>
                    <h4>Activity information
                    </h4>
                    <p>We collect information about how you use Permit Search.  This includes things like your search history, permit details you view, purchase activity, what you’ve clicked on and other uses of our features, and the amount of time you spend
                        looking at different parts of our websites.  When you call or text Permit Search, we collect data about your call or text, including the date and time of the call or text, your phone number, and the content of the call or text.</p>
                    <h4>Device information</h4>
                    <p>Like other websites and apps, we collect data about the browsers and devices you use to access Permit Search.  The data we collect includes browser or device model and settings, operating system, unique identifiers, and the version
                        of the app you’re using. We also collect data about how your browsers and devices interact with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and the URL of the site you visited before
                        Permit Search.</p>
                    <p>You can control our collection of certain data, such as your mobile device model or the language your mobile device uses, by adjusting the privacy and security settings on your mobile device.</p>
                    <h4>Location Information</h4>
                    <p>If you enable location services on your mobile device, Permit Search collects the location of your device.  We use that information to provide you with location-based information and ads, like homes and real estate professionals in
                        your area, and to offer location-based services, like allowing you to unlock and tour Permit Search Offers homes on your own schedule and claiming your home on Permit Search.  If you don’t want to use these features, you can turn
                        off location services on your device.</p>
                    <p>We also collect location information for similar purposes from your browser if you enable it.  You can disable access through your browser settings.</p>

                    <h4>Cookies, pixel tags, and other tracking technologies</h4>
                    <p>We and our partners use various tools to collect data when you visit our sites and apps, including cookies, pixel tags, and other similar technologies. Cookies are bits of electronic data that can be transferred to your computer or
                        other device to identify your browser.</p>
                    <p>When you use Permit Search, we and our partners may use cookies and other tools to gather information about how you view and use our services and content, and to connect your activity with other data we store about you. The use of
                        cookies helps us serve you better by understanding what you’re interested in, tracking trends, measuring the effectiveness of ads, saving your preferences, and storing information you may want to retrieve on a regular basis, such
                        as your favorite homes. We also allow specific, approved partners to collect data from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar tools.</p>
                    <p>You can disable cookies altogether by adjusting the settings on your browser. However, if you choose to disable some or all cookies, many parts of our services may no longer work.  </p>
                    <p>In addition, if you give your email address to us, we may use a scrambled, unreadable form (called a “hashed” version) of your email address to deliver tailored ads to you on Permit Search or on other websites, including via Facebook’s
                        Custom Audience Feature or other similar tools. Click <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/ads/">here</a> to learn about how you can control the ads you see on Facebook.</p>
                    <h4>Social networks</h4>
                    <p>If you use social media logins (like Google and Facebook) to log in to Permit Search, we may access your public social media profile information.  You can always limit this sharing using your social media service settings.</p>
                    <h4>Commercial Information</h4>
                    <p>We collect information about the products and services you purchase or consider purchasing from us.  This includes products for professionals, such as our advertising products, as well as consumer services like Permit Search Offers.</p>

                        ones.  For example, we track how you use our websites and apps and use that information to troubleshoot issues and adjust things to improve your experience.</p>
                    <h4>Communicating with you and connecting you with others</h4>
                    <p>We use the contact information you provide us, like your phone number and email address, to communicate with you about our services.  This includes things like responding to comments, questions, and requests you send us. It also includes
                        notifying you of transaction or service updates and changes.  We may also inform you about our services, offers, promotions, news, and other updates we think may be of interest to you.</p>

                    <p>We use the information we collect about you and your activity on our services to personalize the services we offer.  We also use it to show advertising, content, or features that we think you might like.  This includes things like
                        customized search results that match your preferences and prior search criteria and, if you ask us to, connecting you to a real estate professional best suited to help you.</p>
                    <p>If we know you’re working with a particular real estate agent, we may share information about your saved homes and searches with that agent to let them serve you more effectively.  You control what we share with real estate pros you
                        find on our platform.

                    <h3>Sharing your information
                    </h3>
                    <p>We understand that sharing information with third parties is a big responsibility.  We’re committed to sharing information only when needed for a legitimate business or legal purpose, and then only with recipients who will protect
                        it.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Service providers and business partners</h4>
                    <p>When Permit Search hires a service provider to help operate our business, we may need to give them access to information to provide their service.  We allow them to use the information only to perform the service we’ve asked them to
                        perform.  We vet all service providers carefully, and Permit Search always remains responsible for the privacy of your information that is shared with our service providers.</p>
                    <p>When Permit Search partners with other businesses to offer products and services to you, we may share information with those partners only as needed to provide those products and services and only subject to the terms of this privacy
                        policy.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Legal and compliance transfers</h4>
                    <p>When Permit Search needs to share data to satisfy a legal or regulatory requirement, including responding to a subpoena or other lawful government request for data, we will share information only as necessary to comply with that requirement.
                        We’ll tell you before sharing your information in these situations unless we’re prohibited from doing so.  We may also share information if needed to enforce our legal rights, detect or prevent fraud or security concerns, and protect
                        public safety.</p>
                    <p>If Permit Search is involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of transfer or sale of some or all of its business, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, we may share your information
                        in connection with that transaction.</p>
                    <h4>Public and deidentified data</h4>
                    <p>We may share information that is collected from public sources or that you choose to share publicly (such as public reviews and home facts) with third parties.  We may also share aggregated and/or deidentified information that cannot
                        reasonably be used to identify you.</p>
                    <h4>Sales of personal information</h4>
                    <p>Permit Search allows certain companies to place tracking technologies like cookies and pixels on our sites, which allow those companies to receive information about your activity on Permit Search that is associated with your browser
                        or device.  The companies may use that data to serve you more relevant ads on our sites or others.  Under some state laws, sharing data for online advertising like this may be considered a “sale” of information.  Except for this
                        kind of sharing, Permit Search doesn’t sell any of your information.</p>
                    <p>You always have full control over whether these technologies work on your devices.  You can disable them entirely using our cookie consent preference tools (see the Permit Search Privacy Center for instructions), or by clicking the
                        “Do Not Sell My Information” link on our websites.</p>

                    <p>Permit Search’s third-party ad servers, ad network providers, and third-party advertisers provide ad content that appears on Permit Search. To measure how effective those ads are and to make them more relevant, ad providers may use
                        their own tracking technologies to collect your information. These are used to record users’ activity, such as the pages visited, and to learn what types of information are of most interest to the users. For more information regarding
